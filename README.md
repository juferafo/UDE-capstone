## Project Summary

The work presented in this repository illustrate an extract-transform-load (ETL) process designed to build a data model where data analysts can retreive insights on inmigration and find correlations between the incoming migration to the USA, the global land temperature data and the USA demographic information. In industry, ETLs are widely used to wrangle and enrich raw data before ingesting it into a Data Warehouse (DWH).

This project is organized as follows:

* Step 1: Scope of the project and data gatherig
* Step 2: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Step 3: Data model definition
* Step 4: Run the ETL to model the data
* Step 5: Project write-up
